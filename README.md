# Coba Aja | Just Try

This repo is not a project for building an app. The intention to created this repo was to do some trick in Git like how to : 

1. clone `git clone <repo-name>`
2. push `git push origin <branch-name>`
3. pull `git pull origin <branch-name>`
5. create new branch `git checkout -b <new-branch>`
6. upload local branch `git push origin <local-branch>`
5. delete local branch `git branch -D <local-branch>`
6. delete remote branch `git push -d origin <remote-branch>`
4. create PR `git request-pull <my-branch> <target-branch>`
6. revert to previous commit `git reset <commit-id>`
7. etc 

from terminal / command line / CMD
